**What is expected?** 

The code walkthrough should focus on the critical code in the project.  There
will likely be multiple pieces of code that need to be considered.

1. Document the process used, including who, what, when, where and how
2. Document the results, with an emphasis on issues/problems found
3. Document next steps

There are many resources available online describing code walkthroughs.  These
resources should be consulted and cited.
