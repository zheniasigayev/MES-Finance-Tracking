\section{Problem Statement}

The engineering department currently uses spreadsheets and manual processes to track club finances. This approach
often results in errors from lost reciepts, duplicated claims, and large amount of claims at the end of the year. A centralized
financial tracking software system is needed to streamline and automate this process.

The software will take clear inputs such as budgets, expenses, transactions, receipts, and any other financial
information. The outputs will include reports, summaries, and visual dashboards. This system will be kept simple
so it is easy to use and maintain for future student groups.

Stakeholders include student group leadership teams who manage budget, administrative staff who monitor spending and 
issue reimbursements, and faculty advisors. The environment the software will run on is the department's existing digital 
infrastructure with the software being in the form of a web platform

The importance of the problem lies in improving financial tracking efficiency, reducing the reporting time
and support better financial decision making for student activities. The goals of the project are measurable: minimize
errors in transaction logging and reciept submissions, encourage continuous submissions over the school year rather than 
a large quantity at the end of the year, and provide clear visualization that makes budgets and spending easy to interpret.

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
