The TAs evaluate Advanced (Research) projects via the research report.  This
isn't an extra, but part of the Advanced (Research) evaluation.  The research
report in most cases should be written following the structure of an academic
paper.  There should be components like a motivation, the research questions,
the methodology, the options considered, the evaluations criteria, the results,
etc. In most cases the project supervisor can help with this.
