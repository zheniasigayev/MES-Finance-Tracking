This document outlines the development plan for the MES Club Payment Tracking System, a web application designed to streamline the reimbursement process for McMaster Engineering Society (MES) clubs. The current process using Google Forms and spreadsheets is inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to search. This plan provides the roadmap for design and implementation, describes team and workflow organization, lists the expected technologies, and identifies major risks and mitigation strategies.

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

This project does not contain industry confidential information.

\section{IP to Protect}

The McMaster Engineering Society (MES) will be the primary owner of the system and its deployed instance. The student development team will be credited as contributors. Unless MES requests otherwise, the project will be published under an open-source-friendly license allowing MES and future student teams to maintain and extend the system. If MES requests proprietary handling, we will follow the agreement provided by MES and notify course staff.

\section{Copyright License}

Given that the MES's website source code \href{https://github.com/McMaster-Engineering-Society/MES-Website-App-Router}{is open-source}, we will be using the MIT License.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Weekly team meetings: 60 minutes, fixed weekday time (set by team availability) for planning and progress updates.
  \item Bi-weekly stakeholder check-ins: 30 minutes with MES representative(s) to gather requirements and demo progress.
  \item Meeting format: rotating chair; agenda created as a GitHub issue before each meeting; minutes recorded in the issue and a short summary added to the project wiki.
  \item Ad-hoc technical sessions as needed for design decisions or integration tasks.
  \item Meeting Notes: Will be documented in GitHub Issues linked to the relevant sprint or task.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\begin{itemize}
  \item GitHub Issues for tasks, bugs, feature requests and meeting agendas.
  \item Pull requests for all code changes with at least one reviewer before merging.
  \item Discord for quick coordination.
  \item Email for formal stakeholder communications.
  \item Weekly status updates posted to a shared project board or README for the MES contact.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Git branching: single protected \texttt{main} branch for production; feature branches named \texttt{feature/short-description}; pull requests for merges.
  \item Pull request policy: descriptive PRs, link to issues, at least one approving review and passing CI.
  \item Issue management: issue templates for bug, feature, and documentation; labels for priority and component (frontend/backend/ops).
  \item CI/CD: automatic test runs on PRs; deployments to a staging environment on merges to \texttt{develop} (optional) and production on \texttt{main} after review.
  \item Code reviews: enforce linting and basic tests; use GitHub Actions for automated checks (linters, tests, security scanning).
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We will use GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects to manage work and track progress. Issues will represent tasks, bugs, and feature requests; Projects will be used for sprint planning and high-level roadmaps.
  \item GitHub Projects board (create and link when available): \href{https://github.com/zheniasigayev/MES-Finance-Tracking/projects}{Project board placeholder}
  \item Capstone Repository: \href{https://github.com/zheniasigayev/MES-Finance-Tracking}{https://github.com/zheniasigayev/MES-Finance-Tracking}
  \item MES Website Repository: \href{https://github.com/McMaster-Engineering-Society/MES-Website-App-Router}{https://github.com/McMaster-Engineering-Society/MES-Website-App-Router}
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}
Two main high-risk functionalities have been identified regarding the success of our project that, if not completed, severely hinder achievement of project goals:
\begin {enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Financial data extraction from photos and screenshots:}
    \begin {description} 
      \item[Importance] Although manual data input will be supported, screenshots and images of financial data provides 
 a much more efficient manner of data entry. As streamlining the financials managing process is one of the project's main goals, this is a functionality of high importance. 
      \item[Difficulty of Addressal] The proposed input space includes physical photos: receipts, printed statements, as well as digital formats: screenshots of statements, account balances
    , etc. Although the narrow context (financial data in alphanumerical format) reduce the difficulty of addressing the risk, the wide medium of formats may prove a technical challenge.
    \end {description}
  \item \textbf{Integration with McMaster Engineering Society (MSE) Monorepo:}
    \begin {description} 
      \item[Importance] as mse is client body, bla bla bla
      \item[Difficulty of Addressal] unknown nature of the monorepo, requires thorough communication with mse representatives/supervisors
    \end {description}
\end {enumerate}

A series of minimum Proof of Concept (PoC) functionalities have been proposed to address the risks outlined above:
\begin {enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Text Extraction from Receipt Photos}
  \item \textbf{Basic WebApp hosted within MSE Monorepo}
\end {enumerate}


\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Specific programming language:} JavaScript with Node.js; MongoDB
  \item \textbf{Specific libraries:}  
        Not exactly libraries, but extensions in use: Error Lens, Tailwind CSS Intellisense, Babel JavaScript, Auto Close Tag, Auto Rename Tag, Better Comments
  \item \textbf{Pre-trained models}
  \item \textbf{Specific linter tools:} ESLint, Prettier
  \item \textbf{Specific unit testing framework}
  \item \textbf{Investigation of code coverage measuring tools}
  \item \textbf{Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI):}  
        GitHub Actions (or explain if CI is not being done)
  \item \textbf{Specific performance measuring tools (e.g., Valgrind), if appropriate}
  \item \textbf{Tools you will likely be using}
\end{itemize}


\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\newpage{}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}

\newpage{}

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\wss{borrows from
\href{https://engineering.up.edu/industry_partnerships/files/team-charter.pdf}
{University of Portland Team Charter}}

\subsection*{External Goals}

\wss{What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the
goals related to the functionality or quality fo the project.  These are the
goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.  Potential goals are
to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

Team members are expected to: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Attend scheduled meetings and be on time.
  \item Notify the Project Manager and meeting chair in advance if they cannot attend.
  \item Act professionally and responsibly when absent (review minutes and follow up on assigned actions).
\end{itemize}

Preferred notification is the day before; same-day notification is acceptable for emergencies.

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

Any one of the following reasons that McMaster University recognises, will also be accepted. Below is a list of McMaster's acceptable extenuating circumstances:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Medical issues:} a physical or mental health condition that negatively affected participation or performance. Provide a physician's note or equivalent documentation when available.
  \item \textbf{Family crises:} significant personal or family situations (e.g., bereavement, serious illness) that create hardship.
  \item \textbf{Other personal emergencies:} unforeseen and significant events that disrupt academic or project commitments.
  \item \textbf{Religious observances:} conflicts with religious obligations where accommodation is required.
  \item \textbf{Varsity reasons:} official university sports commitments.
  \item \textbf{Business commitments (part-time students):} job-related duties that prevent attendance.
\end{itemize}

For urgent or sensitive circumstances where documentation cannot be produced immediately, notify the Project Manager promptly and follow up with documentation as soon as reasonably possible. Trivial reasons (e.g., social events) are not considered acceptable without prior agreement.

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

If a team member has an emergency and cannot attend a meeting or complete agreed work, follow these courteous steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Notify the Project Manager and meeting chair as soon as possible (direct message and a short message in the team chat). If unavailable, notify any team lead.
  \item Create a short GitHub Issue titled "emergency: <YourName>" describing current status, outstanding tasks, and the expected return time (if known). Link related issues or PRs.
  \item Where appropriate, assign a backup or delegate specific issues/tasks to another team member and update issue ownership. Use the handover checklist in the issue description.
  \item Share any quick access notes or pointers needed to continue work (location of credentials, relevant commands, how to run tests). Do not post sensitive credentials in chat — use the team's secure credential store or inform the Project Manager privately.
  \item If the absence affects an upcoming demo or deadline, request an immediate short meeting or asynchronous decision from the Project Manager about scope adjustments or re-assignment.
  \item When able, provide a brief follow-up update and, if requested, supporting documentation. On return, do a short handover with whoever covered your work.
\end{enumerate}

These steps prioritise clear communication and minimise disruption while respecting the privacy of the person experiencing the emergency.

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding the quality
of team members' preparation for team meetings and the quality of the
deliverables that members bring to the team?}

\subsubsection*{Attitude}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas,
interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding
team member contributions?  Do you want to introduce a code of conduct?  Do you
want a conflict resolution plan?  Can adopt existing codes of conduct.}

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

\wss{What methods will be used to keep the team on track? How will your team
ensure that members contribute as expected to the team and that the team
performs as expected? How will your team reward members who do well and manage
members whose performance is below expectations?  What are the consequences for
someone not contributing their fair share?}

\wss{You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the TA and
instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
coffee to the next team meeting?  Does the team need to make an appointment with
their TA, or the instructor?  Are there incentives for reaching targets early?}

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

\wss{How will you build team cohesion (fun time, group rituals, etc.)? }

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 

\wss{How will you make decisions in your group? Consensus?  Vote? How will you
handle disagreements? }
