\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag

    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
