Most teams will assess the performance in the VnV report.  In some cases though,
assessing performance will be resource intensive.  In these cases, a performance
report can be written as an extra.  The report should be specific on what
aspects of performance are important, how they are assessed, the measurement
results, and the team improved performance (with specific quantified results).
