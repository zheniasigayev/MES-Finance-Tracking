**What is expected for a Norman’s Principle’s Extra?** 

For this extra we're looking for your team to develop a document that uses
Norman’s Design Principles as a benchmark to evaluate the design decisions made
in the final version of your capstone. Essentially, we want to see a discussion
about how you used every principle in the design, examining aspects of the
project where you applied the principles well, and aspects where the design
could be improved according to the principles. For the extra to achieve full
marks there should be a close to even spread of "good" and "bad" applications of
the principles discussed in the document, with at least three "good" or "bad"
applications analyzed per principle. There should be explanations as to why your
group thinks that aspects of your design achieved a certain principle or
recommendations for how you can improve the design to achieve said principle.
Make sure you include screenshots to aid your explanations. 

For a brief refresher on what Norman’s Principles are:

Visibility – Just by looking at an interface, users should know what their
options are and how to access them

Feedback – Users should receive Feedback (some sort of sensory stimulus)
whenever making an action to let them know the action was successful

Affordance- The link between how things look and how they’re used. This takes
another step past just visibility, closer to the idea of intuitiveness of use
based on appearance

Mapping – The controls for design should closely match their effect

Constraints – Restrict a particular form of user interaction with an interface

Consistency – Having clear recognizable patterns in the design which should
contribute to ease of use
