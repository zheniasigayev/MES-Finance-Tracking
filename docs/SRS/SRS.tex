% 1. Purpose of the Project
%-------------------------------------
\section{Purpose of the Project - Thomas}
  \subsection{User Business - Thomas}
    The McMaster Engineering Society (MES) seeks a more effective and efficient way to manage and track finances of its over 60 student clubs. Due to the current difficuties of 
    the manual proces to manage and track reimbursements, the MES needs to streamline the process so reimbursements can occur regularly throughout the year and have them processed
    quicker to reduce processing times for students. The implementation of our solution will allow student clubs to submit reimbursement requests digitally and in an easier manner, 
    allow MES reviewers to approve or reject requests efficiently, and provide transparency to all parties involved in the reimbursement process. 

  \subsection{Goals of the Project - Thomas}
    The primary goals of the MES Finance Tracking Platform are to:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Provide a user-friendly interface for club members to submit expense reimbursement requests.
      \item Implement a robust review and approval workflow for MES staff to manage reimbursement requests efficiently.
      \item Ensure transparency and traceability of all financial transactions related to club reimbursements.
      \item Maintain data security and privacy in compliance with McMaster University policies.
      \item Integrate seamlessly with existing MES systems and infrastructure.
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Technology Stack Overview}
    The system is a web-based application built with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries, designed to support the needs of the MacEng Society website. The application provides user-facing web pages and administrative features for content management. It is structured as a client-server application where the frontend runs in a web browser and the backend interacts with a database.
    \subsection{Frontend (Client-Side)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed using React/Next.js.
        \item Runs in modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Safari.
        \item Provides the user interface for interacting with content such as council information, events, and bookings.
        \item Fetches and displays data from the backend via RESTful or GraphQL APIs.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Backend (Server-Side)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Executes on the Node.js runtime environment.
        \item Manages application logic, routing, and communication with the database.
        \item Uses MongoDB Community Server as the primary data storage system.
        \item Exposes APIs consumed by the frontend for dynamic content delivery.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Database}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented using MongoDB Community Server.

% 6. Relevant Facts And Assumptions
%-------------------------------------
\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
  \subsection{Relevant Facts}
  There exist a set of relevant facts related to the project that are not considered hard constraints or goals. They have been collected below.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The MES has existing information about clubs stored within the MES monorepo. This data exists in a MongoDB database instance in non-relational, document form.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Their current applications restrict access based on role according to the data stored in this database.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Internal documentation is stored in a seperate repo @ https://github.com/McMaster-Engineering-Society/Documentation (Private Repository)
    \item The MES has existing development practices. For the purposes of this project, they are generally considered \textit{suggestions}.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A Kanban board has been setup for MES stakeholders to track our progress.
        \item Current testing standards consist of informally performing manual end-to-end tests. If proof is required, video captures of testing are standard.
        \item Work will be based on a staging branch in the monorepo specifically for our project.
        \item Pre-existing styled React front-end components exist, and we may use them. 
      \end{itemize} 
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Business rules}
  These rules are imposed on our group, without necessarily directly being imposed as requirements or constraints on the project. Restrictions on group member interaction with existing user data, as an example, falls under this category.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Code and data outside of that which we directly write for the project should not be modified without permission from a MES representative. This includes the aforementioned pre-styled components, any other MES projects, as well as existing user data.
    \item To maintain user privacy, group members will not view production database data. An exception is only allowed in exceptional circumstances under the explicit permission of the project supervisor, who is associated with the MES.
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Assumptions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Development Period:} The development period will be up to the completion of the capstone 4G06 course. Further development may be considered at the discretion of the project supervisor and pending further agreement with development group members.
    \item \textbf{Communication with MES:} It is assumed that the MES will remain open to communication for the purposes of the project during the development period.
    \item \textbf{Developmental Discretion:} Development choices, including changes to any plan documents, are completely up to the discretion of the development group.
  \end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------
% 7. The Scope of the Work
%-------------------------------------
\section{The Scope of the Work}
  \subsection{The Current Situation}
    The MES currently uses spreadsheets and manual processes
    to track club finances. This approach results in a large amount of work for MES financial
    staff due to lost receipts, duplicated claims, or other manual errors. A centralized
    financial tracking platform is needed to streamline and automate this process for the MES.

  \subsection{The Context of the Work}
    The MES Information Technology (IT) team currently has systems and data related to clubs associated
    with their organization. The project however, will not directly interface with most of the other systems.
    The work will be conducted within the MES's monorepo, on an individual staging branch, and production databases
    and code will be owned by the MES.

  \subsection{Work Partitioning}
    Work on the project is to be partitioned such that development can proceed in an efficient manner while
    maintaining traceability and accountability for project supervisors. As the project involves a client body (the MES),
    requirement gathering and communications are included as part of the work.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Initial Requirements Gathering and Communications}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Collection of initial information:} Directly elicit initial requirements, situation context, and problem context from the client body.
          Details about desired project output, existing systems, as well as expectations in terms of client supervision/input during project work.
          \item \textbf{Formal requirement and planning documentation:} Create various documents, including this one, detailing the formal requirements, situation
          information, and development plan for the project.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Proof of Concept (PoC) Development}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Local Wireframe Full-stack App Development:} Create a local implementation including all major system components to be required for the project. Capability of developing the full system will be demonstrated.
          \item \textbf{Receipt Scanning Proof of Concept:} Develop a robust system for extracting finacial data from receipts as a PoC for other physical mediums of financial data. Testing and related documentation will be required to prove system effectiveness.
          \item \textbf{User Authentication Proof of Concept:}  Develop a system to authenticate users and restrict access to system data depending on user role.
          \item \textbf{Integration with MES Monorepo:} Integration of minimum PoC with existing MES monorepo to prove ability to fulfill project under ownership of the MES.
          \item \textbf{PoC Demonstration:} Demonstrate PoC to client and supervisors. Collect feedback and iterate development plans for fulfillment of the rest of project goals and functional requirements.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Integration and Requirement Fulfillment}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Full Development Plan:} Create plan and work delegation for fulfillment of rest of functional requirements and goals of the project.
          \item \textbf{Fulfillment Development:} Fulfill requirements according to plan through software development and iteration, including maintaining iterative communication with client and supervisors.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    In addition to the mentioned work, communication with the client and testing of the application will be maintained during the entire development process.

% 19. Open Issues
%-------------------------------------
\section{Open Issues}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Clubs portal login and administration system is not yet defined, however, it it being developed by MES developers: https://github.com/McMaster-Engineering-Society/MES-Website-App-Router/pull/791.
    \item The existing data is stored in Google Sheets and thus not easy to iterate over. The data will need to be manually migrated to the new system in a manner which has not yet been discussed.
  \end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------
% 20. Off-the-Shelf Solutions
%-------------------------------------
\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
  \subsection{Ready-Made Products}
  Two previous groups attempted to create the MES Finance Tracker system, however, both of their attempts were never integrated into the MES' platform.  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item MES-ERP: https://github.com/Housam2020/MES-ERP
      \item Finance-platform: https://github.com/adampodolak/finance-platform
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Reusable Components}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Third-party OCR software specializing in receipt scanning can be integrated. For example, Amazon's Textract.
      \item There exist reusable React.js components for the front-end that are proided by the MES to conform to thier look and feel requirements.
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item QuickBooks: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/ca/
      \item Expensify: https://www.expensify.com/
      \item Zoho Expense: https://www.zoho.com/expense/
      \item Wave: https://www.waveapps.com/
    \end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------
% 21. Likely Changes
%-------------------------------------
\section{Likely Changes}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The MES will adopt a new database solution (e.g., Postgres) to store audit log trails and other financial data.
    \item The MES may want to add additional features such as budgeting tools or analytics dashboards in the future.
    \item The authentication process might need to support more roles if university administrators want to be involved.
  \end{itemize}    

%-------------------------------------
% 22. Unlikely Changes
%-------------------------------------
\section{Unlikely Changes}    
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Integration with external payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) for direct reimbursements is unlikely in the near term due to complexity and security concerns. Additionally, the MES uses E-Transfer which is free.
    \item Integration with third parties such as Plaid for bank account linking is unlikely due to privacy and security concerns.
    \item The core technology stack (React, Node.js, MongoDB) is unlikely to change significantly give the MES platform is built with these technologies.
  \end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------
% 23. Ideas for Solution
%-------------------------------------
\section{Ideas for Solution}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing a role-aware finance portal on the existing MES Next.js stack with dedicated dashboards for club members, treasurers, and administrators using reusable components (NextUI, Tailwind) that satisfy accessibility requirements.
    \item Building the reimbursement workflow as Next.js API routes on Node.js with MongoDB collections for clubs, requests, budgets, and attachments to enforce audit trails and status tracking.
    \item Establishing a GitHub Actions pipeline for linting, testing with Jest/RTL, and deploying to MES staging/production branches to maintain development workflow commitments.
    \item Using cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for receipt uploads with secure access controls and integrating OCR services (e.g., Amazon Textract) for automated data extraction.
    \item Designing the database schema to support scalability for future features like budgeting tools or analytics dashboards.
    \item Ensuring all sensitive data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest, complying with McMaster University privacy policies.
  \end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

  \subsection{What went well while writing this deliverable?}
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Zhenia Sigayev
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item Splitting up the work was once again an easy process for this deliverable. I believe that everyone was aligned on the project after previous meetings with the MES developers and our own internal meetings.
        \item Due to thorough prior meetings with the MES, the requirements were planned ahead of time and straightforward to write.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Justin Ho
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item Organizing the work so that everyone can get it done on their own time without much time/effort to coordinate. Everyone had a good understanding of the project and what needed to be done.
        \item We were able to leverage the work done by previous groups and MES developers to help inform our requirements. We looked to expand them and make them more complete wherever possible.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Thomas Wang
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item We split up the work well, each person was able to work independently but still get the support from each other during both peer reviews and final submissions. We also communicated better and were able to finish the milestone on time
      \end{itemize}
    \item Michael Shi
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item TODO.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Johnny Qu
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item The work was split up really well and allowed us to collaborate effectively. Because we knew in advance that I would be much busier during certain parts of the timeline, we were able to plan around that and coordinate our schedules effectively so that our work was not blocking each other and we could always progress. 
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your clients or their proxies?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Nearly all of our requirements arose from speaking with our largest client, the MES. Additionally, our group members have been part of clubs that are overseen by the MES, which made reimbursement requirements gathering much easier. For example, it is apparent from the MES and club side that an approval workflow is necessary for both parties. Furthermore, our discussions showed the importance of strong security requirements.
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
    successfully complete this capstone project?}
    % This includes domain specific knowledge or software engineering and/or
    % computer science knowledge. Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
    % or presentation, or team management, etc. You should look to identify at
    % least one item for each team member.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Zhenia Sigayev
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item Align on MES reimbursement rules and compliance so workflows, validations, and audits reflect stakeholder expectations.
        \item Understand NextAuth SSO and granular RBAC that fits privacy mandates and the MES monorepo.
        \item Evaluate OCR options like Textract or custom CV, and package them in resilient async flows so manual entry stays optional.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Justin Ho
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item We needed to understand the existing MES platform and how to integrate our solution into it. This involved learning about their tech stack (Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB) and their development practices.
        \item We also had to familiarize ourselves with financial tracking concepts, including reimbursement workflows, approval
      \end{itemize}
    \item Thomas Wang
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item We require knowledge and testing of how the current system works for finance tracking with the MES. Having insight into what security information and infrastructure is currently outlined to ensure a safe and secure method of transferring money would help in setting up safeguards. Furthermore, having the knowledge to set up monetary transfers directly from out application would allow us to make the functionality apart of our project
      \end{itemize}
    \item Michael Shi
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item TODO.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Johnny Qu
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item Since we're working in to integrate into an existing codebase, there is a lot of processes we need to learn in order to not interupt existing workflows. We will need to understand how the existing systems work and general processes within the MES. From initial meetings with the development team, there are a few coding practices, like seperating code into slices, that are new to me and that I will have to pick up.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{What parts of this deliverable has each team member contributed to?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Zhenia Sigayev
      \begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
        \item Created the inital skeleton of the SRS document by integrating SRS-Volere into the normal SRS document.
        \item The entire "Mandated Constraints" section which includes subsections: Solution Constraints, Current MES Finance Tracker, Cost Constraints, Off-the-Shelf Software, Schedule Constraints, Workflow Constraints, and Enterprise Constraints.
        \item All of "Terminology, Acronyms, and Technologies" section.
        \item The subsection "The Current Situation".
        \item The subsections Functional Requirements, Ease of Use and Learning Requirements, Learning Requirements, Understandability and Politeness Requirements, Accessibility Requirements.
        \item Completed sections Reusable Components, Off-the-Shelf Solutions, Products That Can Be Copied, Likely Changes, Unlikely Changes, Ideas for Solution.
        \item Part of "What went well while writing this deliverable?", "What went well while writing this deliverable?"
        \item Completed the subsection "How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your clients or their proxies?"
        \item Delegated various last-mile remaining sections to all team members.
      \end{itemize}
