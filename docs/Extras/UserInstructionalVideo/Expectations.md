For some projects a user instructional video makes more sense than a written
user manual.  The video should give the purpose of the software and focus on all
the typical use cases for the software.  Someone using the video should be able
to learn how to use the software, without having to have an in-person training
session with the development team.  The team should assess whether this goal is
achieved by testing the user instructional video on their users.
